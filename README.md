the [DY* communication
layer](https://github.com/REPROSEC/dolev-yao-star-extrinsic/tree/main/src/lib/communication)

implemented:

- Minimal example for the
  [confidential](src/single_conf_message/)
  send and receive functions
- Minimal example for the
  [authenticated](src/single_auth_message/)
  send and receive functions
- Minimal example for the [confidential and authenticated](src/single_conf_and_auth_message/) send and receiver functions
- Minimal example for the [request-response pair](src/request_response/) send and receive functions
